# Book-Author Relationship Database Project

this project simulates a many-to-many relationship between authors and books using SQLAlchemy. It includes random data generation for authors and books using the Faker library and provides several query functions to retrieve information from the database, such as finding the author with no books, the book with the most pages, and more.


## Features
